# fuzzy_shopping_cart
This freestanding application was built using [Webstorm]([https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/]).
## Maleni's fuzzy shopping carts project description
A HTML, React, and JSX project that includes shopping cart programing for products, restock features, and contents. Bootstrap was imported for the webpage's button styling with routing.
## Project Setup on Your Machine
This project can easily be started cloning the repository in your IDE terminal by copying the HTTPS link from the green code button on my Github repo page. 
## Project Improvement Opportunities
For future improvements, I plan on distinguishing the individual product features for each shopping cart. The shopping carts are currently using react, but are in standalone mode.
